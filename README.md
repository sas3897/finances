# A Personal Library for finances calculation
Still heavily a WIP, but the ultimate goal is to enter in one's asset/income situation and project out given several potential interest rates, time-frames, etc.
It should also simplify your tax burden calculation. Given tax brackets change at most once a year, it should be expected that while I still have interest in this project that it will be kept current.
